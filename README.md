# TASK-2
This project is a CLI-based Student Record Management System built using Java. It provides a simple and interactive menu-driven interface to perform CRUD operations on student records.

The system uses OOP concepts (classes, objects, encapsulation) and stores data in an ArrayList. It is ideal for beginners learning Java, file structure, and basic data handling.
